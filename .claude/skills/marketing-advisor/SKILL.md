# Marketing Advisor

## Purpose

This skill ensures features align with DEBT-OS's brand positioning and market messaging. Claude should consider marketing implications when implementing features that affect how the product is perceived.

## When to Activate

Claude should consider this perspective when:
- Implementing features that will be marketed
- Creating user-facing messaging or copy
- Planning product announcements
- Evaluating competitive positioning
- Building features for specific personas

## Key Marketing Principles

### Brand Positioning

**Tagline**: "AI Agents That Understand Your Code"

**Value Proposition**: DEBT-OS is an AI-powered platform that automatically detects, explains, and plans remediation for technical debt, helping engineering teams build faster with confidence.

**Brand Attributes**:
- **Intelligent** - AI that truly understands code, not just pattern matching
- **Actionable** - Every finding includes remediation steps
- **Transparent** - Shows evidence and reasoning, not black-box results
- **Collaborative** - Multiple agents working together
- **Adaptive** - Learns from feedback

### Target Audiences

**Primary - Engineering Leadership (CTOs, VPs)**:
- Data-driven decision makers
- Focused on velocity and quality balance
- Need visibility, risk mitigation, strategic planning

**Secondary - Tech Leads / Senior Engineers**:
- Quality-focused, time-constrained, pragmatic
- Need better code quality, reduced review burden

**Tertiary - Platform Engineers**:
- Building developer tooling, CI/CD owners
- Need automation, integration, reliable metrics

### Messaging Framework

**Core Message**: "DEBT-OS is the first technical debt platform powered by collaborative AI agents that don't just find problems—they understand why they exist and how to fix them."

**Supporting Messages**:
1. "Multiple AI Agents. One Clear Picture." - Multi-agent intelligence
2. "From Problem to Plan in Minutes" - Actionable remediation
3. "Understand Your Code's Story" - Historical context
4. "A Platform That Gets Smarter" - Continuous learning

### Brand Voice

**Do**:
- Use developer-familiar terminology
- Provide specific, measurable claims
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Be honest about capabilities

**Don't**:
- Use buzzwords without substance
- Promise to "eliminate all debt"
- Use fear-based messaging
- Overpromise results

### Competitive Sound Bites

- vs. SonarQube: "SonarQube tells you what's wrong. DEBT-OS tells you why and how to fix it."
- vs. CodeClimate: "CodeClimate gives you metrics. DEBT-OS gives you a plan."
- vs. No Solution: "Technical debt doesn't go away. DEBT-OS makes it visible and manageable."

## Questions to Ask

When implementing features:
- Does this align with our brand positioning?
- How would we message this to our target audience?
- Does the terminology match our brand voice?
- Is this feature differentiating vs. competitors?
